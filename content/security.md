# Security Policy

The Rux team takes the security of the compiler and its toolchain seriously. Thank you for helping keep Rux and its users safe.

## Supported Versions

Rux is under active pre-1.0 development. Security fixes are applied to the latest released minor line only; older minor lines are not maintained.

| Version                                  | Security fixes |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Latest release                           | Supported      |
| Older releases and development snapshots | Not supported  |

We recommend reproducing reports against the latest release when it is safe to do so, while still identifying the originally affected version.

## Scope

This policy covers everything the Rux project ships and runs:

- the **compiler**, linker, CLI and package manager, release artifacts, and installer scripts;
- the **package registry** at [rux-lang.dev/packages](/packages) and its API at `api.rux-lang.dev`, including authentication, API tokens, namespace ownership, and published package content;
- the **playground**, which compiles and runs submitted code in a sandbox; and
- this **website**.

Use the private channels below for all of them, so the maintainers can route a report without public disclosure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions.**

Instead, report them privately using one of the following channels:

- **Email:** [info@rux-lang.dev](mailto:info@rux-lang.dev)
- **GitHub:** Use the repository's **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability** to open a [private report](https://github.com/rux-lang/Rux/security/advisories/new).

To help us triage quickly, please include as much of the following as you can:

- The type of issue (e.g. memory corruption, code injection via crafted source, path traversal in the package manager, sandbox escape, authentication or authorization bypass, etc.)
- The affected component (lexer, parser, codegen, linker, CLI, package manager, registry, playground, website)
- Rux version and host platform (OS, architecture, compiler)
- Whether the issue affects source compilation, produced binaries, package installation, or the installer itself
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce, including any minimal source input
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code, if available
- The impact of the issue and how an attacker might exploit it

Reports written in English are preferred.

Do not include secrets or personal data that are not required to demonstrate the issue. If a report needs a large or sensitive attachment, contact us first and arrange a private transfer method.

## Our Commitment

When you report a vulnerability, you can expect us to:

- **Acknowledge** receipt of your report within **3 business days**.
- Provide an initial **assessment** within **10 business days**.
- Keep you informed of progress toward a fix and a release.
- Treat your report **confidentially** and not share your details without your permission.
- **Credit** you for the discovery when the fix is published, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a **coordinated disclosure** process:

1. You report the vulnerability privately.
2. We confirm the issue and develop a fix.
3. We prepare a release and a security advisory.
4. We publicly disclose the vulnerability after a fix is available, typically within **90 days** of the initial report.

We ask that you give us a reasonable opportunity to address the issue before any public disclosure.

## Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in good faith and in accordance with this policy to be authorized. We will not pursue or support legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption.
- Only interact with systems and accounts they own or have explicit permission to access.
- Report vulnerabilities promptly and do not exploit them beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.

Thank you for helping make Rux more secure.
