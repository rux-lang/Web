# Memory

Memory management functions: raw allocation and the block operations that go with it.

Every function dispatches on `#target.os` at compile time, so a build carries exactly one platform's implementation — `mmap`/`munmap` on Linux, macOS, and the BSDs, and the process heap on Windows.

## Installation

```sh
rux add Rux/Memory
```

## What it provides

| Function         | Purpose                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Alloc`          | Allocate an uninitialized block                                 |
| `Realloc`        | Resize a block, preserving its contents                         |
| `Free`           | Release a block                                                 |
| `Copy`           | Copy bytes between blocks that do not overlap                   |
| `Move`           | Copy bytes between blocks that may overlap in any way           |
| `Set`            | Fill a block with a byte value                                  |
| `Zero`           | Fill a block with zero                                          |
| `Compare`        | Order two blocks lexicographically, returning an `Ordering`     |
| `Equal`          | Whether two blocks hold the same bytes                          |
| `MismatchOffset` | Where two blocks first differ, or their length when they do not |
| `Find`           | Where a byte first occurs, or the length when it does not       |

| `PageSize` / `MinimumPageSize` / `PageAlign` | Asking the system its real page size, the documented floor, and rounding a length to that floor |
| `PageAllocate` / `PageRelease` / `PageProtect` | Address space at the granularity the system hands it out in |

**Zero length is always legal, and null is legal with it.** `Copy(null, null, 0)` is defined and does nothing. That is deliberately not C's rule, where passing null to `memcpy` is undefined even for a zero length — a rule that turns an ordinary empty case into a trap and makes every caller guard.

`Copy` may be read as copying byte zero first, so a destination overlapping the source ahead of it reads bytes the copy has already overwritten. `Move` is defined for every overlap and chooses its direction accordingly.

The page layer is what sits under an allocator, not an allocator itself. Nothing there tracks what it gave out or remembers a length; a caller releases exactly what it took. Failure is a `PageError` rather than an errno, a `GetLastError` code or a sentinel address — one set of reasons across four systems that report three different ways.

Windows differs in kind: it separates reserving address space from committing storage to it, and `PageAllocate` always does both, which is what every other system does and what an allocator expects. A caller wanting a large reservation cheaply has to reach for `Rux/Windows` directly.

`PageSize` asks the system, and reports whether it got an answer. Each platform package owns its own query — `GetSystemInfo` on Windows, `getpagesize` on Darwin, the `hw.pagesize` sysctl on FreeBSD, and `/proc/self/auxv` on Linux, whose kernel publishes the value in the auxiliary vector rather than behind a system call. Nothing is captured at process start and no libc is called. When the system will not answer — a container built without `/proc` is the ordinary way that happens — this reports `Unsupported` rather than substituting a number, because a caller asking for the real size is worse served by a wrong one than by a refusal.

`PageAlign` rounds to `MinimumPageSize`, which is 4 KiB and is the floor on every supported cell rather than the size on any particular one: Apple Silicon uses 16 KiB, and a Linux kernel may be configured for 16 or 64. Rounding to a divisor of the real size cannot make an allocation wrong — every call here hands the length to a system that rounds again — and it keeps a file read out of an allocator's inner loop. A caller that needs whole _real_ pages asks `PageSize` once, keeps the answer, and rounds with `AlignUp` itself.

None of the comparisons is constant-time: each stops at the first difference, so none may compare a secret.

## Value and ownership model

`PageError` is a structural `Copy` value. Every address remains a raw pointer because this package exposes byte ranges, nullable allocation failure, stored addresses, pointer arithmetic, and explicit release—the operations for which references cannot prove validity or ownership. `Alloc` and `PageAllocate` transfer ownership to the caller; `Free` and `PageRelease` end it. No destructor runs automatically, so never copy an owning address with the intent of freeing both copies. Scalar output slots are also raw: pass writable addresses such as `@result` and obey the function's non-null contract.

> **Changed in this release.** `Compare` now returns an `Ordering`, which is what this table always claimed it did;
> the old first-difference offset is `MismatchOffset`, and `Equal` is what most callers of the old `Compare` wanted.
> `Set` takes its arguments in `memset` order — destination, value, length — where it previously took the length
> before the value, and its value is a `byte` rather than an `int32`, so a mistaken call fails to compile.

## Example

```rux
import Memory::{ Alloc, Free, Zero };

var buffer = Alloc(1024);
if buffer != null {
    Zero(buffer, 1024);
    Free(buffer);
}
```
