The module names describe where each declaration comes from; they are not part of an import path.

A `Layout` that exists is valid. `Layout::New` refuses an alignment that is not a power of two, or a size whose rounding would pass the end of the address space — so nothing downstream checks again. That second case is the one worth naming: it is how a request for a huge array becomes an allocation far smaller than the caller asked for. Use `Layout::ForValue<T>()` or `Layout::ForArray<T>(count)` when storage follows a type; neither requires a sample value, so describing a move-only type consumes nothing.

Four promises hold for every allocator here:

- **The address satisfies the layout.** Always.
- **The contents are undefined.** Nothing here zeroes; the page layer does, because the operating system does.
- **A release must match its allocation** — the same pointer, and an equal layout. The allocator needs the size to know what it is taking back.
- **A failure leaves everything alone.** A failed reallocation leaves the original block valid and still the caller's.

Every operation returns a native fallible: `Allocate` and `Reallocate` give `(*var opaque) ! AllocError`, and `Deallocate` gives `! AllocError`. Every `AllocError` case is a failure, so a caller propagates with `?`, recovers with `catch`, and a result left unhandled is diagnosed as discarded. A release on a cleanup path that has nobody to report to says so explicitly with `allocator.Deallocate(block, layout) catch { else => {} };`.

A zero-sized layout is legal and gives a non-null aligned address that nothing may be read from or written to, and which must still be released. That is cheaper than a null case every caller has to branch on, and it keeps an empty collection from being a special shape.

`Arena`, `Pool`, `FixedBuffer`, and `Box<T>` prohibit copying. The first two and the box use canonical destructors; the fixed buffer owns no storage but still cannot be copied because duplicate bump state could hand out overlapping blocks. Move an owner explicitly, for example `let destination <- source`. `Box::Create` returns `Box<T> ! AllocError`, destroying the value it was given when the allocator refuses. Destroying a box destroys its value before returning the allocation, while `TryTake` moves the value to the caller and leaves the box empty.

Canonical construction is `SystemAllocator()`, `Arena(backing, blockSize)`, `Pool(backing, blocksPerChunk)`, and `FixedBuffer(storage, capacity)`. `Layout::New` retains its name because it validates and returns `Layout?`, so `Layout::New(size, alignment) ?? fail AllocError::Unsupported` turns an unrepresentable layout into a failure.

An `Arena` hands out storage by advancing a pointer and takes it all back at once, which is the right shape whenever a program builds many small things whose lives end together. Blocks come from a backing allocator and each is twice the size of the last, so a long-lived arena stops going back to the system. `Reset` rewinds every allocation while keeping the largest block, so a second round of the same work asks the system for nothing. `BytesUsed` sums what every block has handed out, alignment padding included; the tail a block is left with when a request moves on to a new block is not counted.

Borrow a concrete implementation directly for a short-lived interface view, for example `let view: &var Allocator = system`. Arena, pool, and fixed-buffer handles are storable adapters for allocators whose mutable state must stay with an owner. A handle stores a raw pointer because references cannot be fields or returned; it must not outlive or survive a move of its owner.

An arena accepts a release rather than refusing one, so it can stand in for any allocator in generic code that releases what it takes. Ordinary releases do nothing; the most recent allocation is rewound, which is what lets a growing collection in an arena avoid wasting every earlier size it passed through.

A `FixedBuffer` is the arena's shape without the arena's appetite: it hands out storage the caller already has, never asks anyone for more, and reports `OutOfMemory` when the buffer runs out. That makes it the allocator for the places where allocation must not happen — a fixed working set, a signal-safe path, a target with no allocator underneath at all. It owns nothing and has no destructor, but its copy operation is prohibited because copying its state while it is in use would hand out the same storage twice.

A `Pool` is for the other shape — many small values whose lives end at different times and in no particular order. A request is rounded up to one of five power-of-two classes, each keeping its own free list, so both allocation and release are a pointer swap with no search and no coalescing. A class that runs dry takes one chunk from a backing allocator and carves it, so the backing allocator sees one request per chunk rather than one per block. Rounding up is what pays for the speed: a 17-byte request occupies a 32-byte block, and those 15 bytes are not recoverable until the chunk is released. A request too large for the largest class, or needing a stricter alignment than a chunk is taken at, goes straight to the backing allocator — decided from the layout alone, so a release reaches the same conclusion as its allocation without the pool recording anything per block.

`SystemAllocator` is page-granular, so a small allocation costs a whole page. It is the backing store for an arena or a pool rather than the allocator a program uses for many small values directly.
