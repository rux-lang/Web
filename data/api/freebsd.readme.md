The module names describe where each declaration comes from; they are not part of an import path.

FreeBSD reports an error by setting the carry flag and leaving a _positive_ errno in the result register, so a raw instruction result cannot be tested for sign. The assembly wrappers normalize that to a small negative number, which is Linux's convention, so everything above them reads the same on both systems and `IsError` and `Errno` are the same two functions.

Nothing here is interchangeable with `Rux/Linux`, and the resemblance is the hazard. The clock identifiers differ — monotonic is 4 here and 1 there — the open flags are the BSD ones, `MADV_DONTNEED` does not discard where Linux's does, and only the errno numbers below thirty-five agree. A value taken from one package and passed to the other compiles and means something else.

`QueryPageSize` reads the `hw.pagesize` sysctl, which is how FreeBSD publishes the value; there is no dedicated call and no auxiliary vector to read without libc.

## The shared POSIX contract

Nothing here is interchangeable with the other POSIX packages, but the three are _spelled_ the same, which is a different claim and a deliberate one. An equivalent call has the same wrapper name, the same parameter names and the same parameter shapes on all three systems, so a consumer such as [`Rux/FileSystem`](../FileSystem) or [`Rux/Time`](../Time) writes one call site instead of a `when #target.os` ladder around three names for one idea. `Tests/Unit/PlatformBindingContractTests.cpp` compares the three packages' parsed sources and fails when they drift apart.

The values are the opposite: every constant is this system's own, and the same file asserts that the ones a reader might carry across really do differ.

## What is tested

`Tests/Packages/FreeBSD/Descriptors` covers descriptor numbering, short reads and writes, end of file, size boundaries and the native error for each way of misusing a descriptor or a name. `Tests/Packages/FreeBSD/Mapping` covers anonymous mappings, protection changes, advice, the requests the kernel refuses, and both edges of the reserved error-result window. `Tests/Packages/FreeBSD/Syscall` covers the wrapper surface and the shared POSIX contract.

All of it compiles for both architectures, and none of it has ever run on a host that is not FreeBSD. Until it does, the syscall numbers, flag values and errno constants here rest on published documentation rather than on a passing test.

## Values and pointers

Kernel records such as `Timespec` are structural values and copy by value. Syscall wrappers deliberately retain raw pointers because the kernel consumes untyped integer addresses, buffers carry separate lengths, and optional outputs may be null. Pass addresses explicitly, for example `ClockGetTime(ClockMonotonic, @time)`, and uphold each function's safety contract. The package does not own raw addresses or descriptors; release them explicitly or use the higher-level `Rux/Memory` and `Rux/Io` packages.

## Platform

FreeBSD only. Guard use behind a compile-time check, so a build for another target never resolves these declarations:

```rux
import Core::{ #target };

when #target.os {
    .FreeBSD => import FreeBSD::{ StdOut, Write }
}
```

Higher-level packages such as [`Rux/Io`](../Io) and [`Rux/Memory`](../Memory) already do this, and are the interface to prefer unless you need the syscall itself.

## AArch64 ABI

The AArch64 wrappers follow the FreeBSD syscall convention: the call number is placed in `x8`, up to six wrapper arguments are shifted into `x0` through `x5`, and `svc #0` enters the kernel. A carry-set return is converted from a positive `errno` to the negative result used by the package API.

Descriptor and clock identifiers are sign-extended before entering the generic `uint64` syscall interface. `Mmap` likewise preserves a signed descriptor while passing the FreeBSD 15.1 mapping constants and all six arguments directly. The same source keeps a separate set of x86-64 wrappers, which reach the kernel through `syscall` and normalize the carry flag the same way.
