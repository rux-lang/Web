# Core

Core declares primitive associated constants, diagnostics, value protocols, and compile-time context.

Core is optional. Scalar types, arithmetic, arrays, inferred string literals, and range syntax work without it. Every primitive type is built into the compiler; Core extends them, and importing a primitive from Core imports its associated constants. Slice and range fields are compiler-owned. A replacement package can provide the same extensions and intrinsic declarations; the compiler assigns no privilege to the name or manifest identity of Core.

## Installation

```sh
rux add Rux/Core
```

## What it provides

- **Compile-time context** — `#target` (os, arch, abi, endian, pointer width, data model, object format, triple, `HasFeature`), `#build`, `#compiler`, `#source`, and `#config`, together with the enums they are typed by: `OperatingSystem`, `Architecture`, `ApplicationBinaryInterface`, `Endianness`, `DataModel`, `ObjectFormat`, `BuildMode`, `OptimizationMode`, `OutputKind`, `TargetFeature`.
- **Diagnostics** — `Assert`, `DebugAssert`, and `Panic` report and terminate; `#Error` and `#Warn` reject or flag an unsupported configuration while compiling and produce no runtime code. A release build removes `DebugAssert` checks without evaluating their arguments. Neither `Assert` nor `Panic` unwinds, so no destructor runs on the way out — anything that must be released on a failing path belongs to a caller that saw the failure, which is what a native fallible `T ! E` is for.
- **Native outcome questions** — `Succeeded` and `Failed` answer which channel a native fallible `T ! E` holds without unwrapping it. Native forms have no methods of their own, so these are ordinary generic functions; each takes the outcome by value, so a call's result is asked directly and a named outcome with a move-only payload is passed as `<-outcome`.
- **Ordering** — the result of a three-way comparison, with `IsLess`, `IsEqual`, `IsGreater`, the derived `IsLessOrEqual` and `IsGreaterOrEqual`, and `Reverse`. Absence and failure are not library types: they are the native optional `T?` and fallible `T ! E`, with the native unit `()` for an operation with nothing to report.
- **Interfaces for generic code** — `Equatable` and `Comparable` borrow their `Self`-typed operands through non-null references, `Hashable` gives the 64-bit summary a table keys on, and `Iterator`/`Iterable` name the iteration protocol the compiler drives by shape. Resource types prohibit copying with a bodyless canonical `=` and release themselves with `~Type`. Bounds such as `func Sort<T: Comparable>(...)` resolve `Self` to each type argument without dynamic dispatch.
- **Integer arithmetic** — `AddChecked`, `SubChecked`, and `MulChecked` report whether the true answer was representable and write the machine's answer either way; `AddWrapping`, `SubWrapping`, and `MulWrapping` name the wrapping that `+`, `-`, and `*` already do; `AddSaturating`, `SubSaturating`, and `MulSaturating` clamp to whichever limit the true answer ran past. `MaximumOf` and `MinimumOf` report a type's limits. All are generic over the integer type and work at every width, signed and unsigned, deriving a type's zero, signedness, and limits from one operand rather than being written out per width. The operation comes first in each name because `CheckedAdd`, `CheckedSub`, and `CheckedMul` already name the compiler's `uint64` intrinsics, which are emitted inline and are what allocation-size arithmetic is written with.
- **Bit operations** — `CountOnes`, `CountZeros`, `LeadingZeros`, `TrailingZeros`, `LeadingOnes`, `TrailingOnes`, `RotateLeft`, `RotateRight`, `ReverseBits`, `ReverseBytes`, `BitAt`, `BitWidthOf`, `IsPowerOfTwo`, and `ShiftRightLogical`. All are generic over the integer type and right at every width, signed and unsigned: `>>` copies the sign bit down on a signed type, so everything that reads a value's bits as bits goes through `ShiftRightLogical`, which brings zeros in either way.
- **Byte order** — `ToLittleEndian`, `FromLittleEndian`, `ToBigEndian`, and `FromBigEndian` convert a value already in a register; `StoreLittleEndian`, `StoreBigEndian`, `LoadLittleEndian`, and `LoadBigEndian` move one through raw bytes at any alignment, which is what a file or wire format needs. `TargetIsLittleEndian` reports this target's own order, established from its storage rather than from a list of known targets.
- **Checked conversion** — `ConvertChecked` reports whether a primitive value survived the conversion and writes the machine's answer either way; `ConvertWrapping` names the wrapping `as` already does, and `ConvertSaturating` clamps to the destination's range. Every check is a round trip in the source type, plus one test for the pair a round trip cannot see — a value and its conversion that disagree in sign, which is how `-1` reaches `uint64`. `IsSignedType` reports whether a type has values below zero.
- **Float classification** — `IsNaN`, `IsZero`, `IsInfinite`, `IsFinite`, `IsNegativeZero`, `IsSignNegative`, `IsSignPositive`, and `SignOf`. All are arithmetic rather than bit inspection, so one implementation serves every float width including the software-lowered ones, whose storage carries padding no generic function could locate a sign bit inside of. The sign of a zero, which comparison cannot see, is read from the infinity it divides into.
- **Primitive associated constants** — `Bits`, `Bytes`, `Min`, `Max` and the floating-point set (`Lowest`, `MinPositive`, `Epsilon`, `Infinity`, `NaN`) for the supported integer and character widths, width metadata for supported booleans, and the finite/special constant set for `float32` and `float64`. Reserved widths remain unimplemented. The string widths expose none: a string is a view over code units rather than a value with a width, so a width or a limit would describe neither it nor the units.

## Primitive constants and imports

```rux
import Core::int8;

func Main() -> int {
    let minimum = int8::Min;
    let message: char8[..] = "hello";
    return message.length as int + minimum as int;
}
```

`int8` is built into the compiler, so it names the scalar type without an import; `import Core::int8;` imports Core's `extend int8` block, which is what makes `int8::Min` available. The built-in aliases import their canonical widths: `import Core::byte;` gives `byte::Max`, the same constant as `uint8::Max`, and `import Core::bool;` gives `bool::Bits`. Loading a dependency that imports it does not import its APIs into the caller. The same rule applies between source files.

Core declares no primitive type: each primitive file holds one documented `extend` block. Core defines integer and character limits, width metadata, and finite floating constants using ordinary constant expressions. Native integer metadata uses `sizeof`, so it follows the compilation target. Only floating-point `Infinity` and `NaN` use bodyless `intrinsic const` declarations inside extensions.

## Sequence views and ranges

The language supplies read-only `T[..]` and writable `var T[..]` views. Neither annotation needs a Core import. Their `.data` and `.length` fields are compiler-owned. A view owns no storage, and copying it copies two words. Its backing storage must remain alive while it is used.

```rux
func Sum(values: int[..]) -> int {
    var total = 0;
    for value in values { total += value; }
    return total;
}

func Fill(values: var int[..], value: int) {
    for index in 0..values.length { values[index] = value; }
}

func Main() -> int {
    var storage: int[3] = [1, 2, 3];
    let view = storage[..];
    Fill(view, 4);
    return Sum(view) - 12;
}
```

A writable view weakens to a read-only one implicitly; a read-only view cannot be strengthened. Binding a view with `let` does not freeze its pointee. `[]` constructs an empty view when a slice type is expected. Use `pointer[..length]` to view raw storage, and `view[start..end]` to select a subview. Pointer ranges require an end because pointers carry no length. These operations use element counts rather than byte counts.

Ranges are written `int..int`, `int..=int`, `int..`, `..int`, `..=int`, and `..` in annotations. Their `.start` and `.end` fields exist only when the corresponding bound exists, with no declaration or import required.

Literal text is `char8[..]`, `char16[..]`, or `char32[..]`; the prefixes are `c8`, `c16`, and `c32`, and an unprefixed literal uses UTF-8. The descriptor length counts code units, excluding the trailing NUL in literal storage. Text can be passed directly to a function taking the corresponding read-only character slice. Slicing can split an encoded scalar, so validated-text operations belong in Text and Unicode. A literal cannot become a writable view.

Core diagnostic messages and compile-time context text use `char8[..]`. External functions taking raw pointers receive `"literal".data`. Concrete slice extensions can add methods for one element type; reusable generic algorithms use ordinary generic functions.

## Ownership and borrowing

Core methods borrow ordinary values with `&T` and mutable receivers with `&var T`; callers pass the value directly and the compiler creates the short-lived borrow. Named move-only values require `<-` when ownership crosses a binding, call, assignment, return, or consuming receiver. Copyable Core values use generated structural copying. Canonical constructors are type calls such as `SemanticVersion(1, 2, 3)`, and descriptive factories retain their names.

Raw pointers remain where absence, storage, or address arithmetic is part of the contract: slice fields, nullable `TryInto*` outputs, unchecked checked-arithmetic/conversion destinations, byte-order buffers, and zeroization.

`Assert` and `Panic` failures have the same UTF-8, LF-terminated layout on every supported target:

```text
Assertion failed: message
  at Function (path:line:column)
```

`Panic` uses `Panic: message` on the first line. The location uses a package-relative path when the source belongs to the package root, and qualified method or module names are retained.

## Example

```rux
import Core::{ #target, #Error };

when #target.os {
    .Windows, .Linux, .macOS, .FreeBSD => {},
    else => #Error("Unsupported operating system")
}
```

```rux
import Core::{ Assert, SemanticVersion };

func Major(version: &SemanticVersion) -> uint {
    return version.major;
}

func Main() -> int {
    let version = SemanticVersion(1, 2, 3);
    let answer: int32? = .Some(42i32);
    Assert(Major(version) == 1u, "borrowed version");
    Assert((answer ?? 0i32) == 42i32, "present optional value");
    return 0;
}
```
