# Path

Native operating-system strings and filesystem paths.

## Installation

```sh
rux add Rux/Path
```

## What it provides

- **`OsString` and `OsStringView`** — text as the operating system actually stores it: arbitrary bytes on the Unix systems, arbitrary UTF-16 code units on Windows, unpaired surrogates included. Lossless by construction: whatever name the system hands over survives the round trip, whether or not it is valid text. Conversion **from** UTF-8 always succeeds; conversion **to** UTF-8 is fallible, because the system's names are under no obligation to be text.

- **`Path` and `PathBuffer`** — borrowed structure and the owning, growable buffer; component iteration where separator runs count once and an absolute path opens with an empty root component.
- **Parts and joins** — `Parent`, `FileName`, `Stem`, `Extension`, `Join`, and lexical `Normalize`, each edge decided in writing — including that `x/..` simplification is the truth about directories and a lie about symlinks, with the filesystem-true answer deferred to canonicalization.
- **Prefixes** — the Windows family (drive, UNC share, verbatim) behind `PrefixLength`, `HasRoot` and `IsAbsolute`; the Unix systems have no prefixes, and nothing here folds case.
- **Two renderings, neither compromising** — `OsStringView`, `OsString`, `Path` and `PathBuffer` implement `Display` and `Debug`. `Display` is the name as a reader should see it, with every native unit that is not text replaced by U+FFFD: lossy on purpose, for a message, never for reopening a file. `Debug` is the name as it is, quoted, with a Unix byte outside a well-formed sequence written `\x{nn}` and a Windows code unit with no partner written `\u{xxxx}`, so nothing is lost and two different names never render alike. A precision is refused by both rather than applied, because a truncated path is a different path and may be one that exists. The exact conversions and the filesystem operations are untouched by either.

`Path` and `OsStringView` are copyable borrowed values whose receivers use `&T`. Immutable `OsString` has deep-copy value semantics: a language copy allocates an independent native-unit block from the same allocator. `PathBuffer` prohibits copying, transfers with `<-`, and releases its block through `~PathBuffer`.

Use `Path()`, `OsStringView()`, `OsString(allocator)`, and `PathBuffer(allocator)` for empty values. Descriptive and fallible factories such as `FromText`, `FromPath`, `Join`, and `Normalize` retain their names and return their value `! TextError`, as `OsStringView.ToText` returns `String ! TextError`. Raw pointers remain only for native storage and scalar output slots, where nullable or stored addresses are required.
