## Design

This package does one thing: fill a buffer with bytes an adversary cannot guess. It is not a generator. There is no state here, nothing is reproducible, and drawing many bytes is slower than drawing them from a seeded generator — ask here for a seed, and take the rest from `Rux/Random`.

Four systems offer four interfaces. Linux and FreeBSD have a `getrandom` system call that may write fewer bytes than asked for and may be interrupted by a signal, so filling a whole buffer means looping; a signal is retried a bounded number of times and then reported as `Interrupted` rather than spun on forever. Darwin's `arc4random_buf` is seeded before any user code runs, never blocks, and cannot fail, so it returns nothing at all. Windows has `BCryptGenRandom`, which fills the whole buffer or fails, and reports through an `NTSTATUS` rather than an error number. One `EntropyError` covers all four.

A failure leaves nothing usable behind. Whatever a short read managed to write is zeroized before the failure is reported, because a half-filled key looks exactly as random as a whole one — a caller who ignores the result should get an obviously wrong buffer rather than a subtly weak one.

## Injecting failures

Entropy failures are the ones nobody tests. Reaching them needs a kernel with no generator, a process being signalled steadily, or a cryptographic provider that refuses — none of which a test can arrange. So `FillFrom` takes an `EntropySource` rather than calling the system by name: `SystemEntropy` is the real one, and a test supplies one that fails exactly when it wants it to. The code that handles a failure is then the same code in the test and in production, which is the only way to know it works.

`FillFrom` borrows an `EntropySource` interface view for the duration of the call. The view refers to the original source rather than copying it, so an implementation can keep mutable state directly in its own fields and callers observe the same state after the fill.

`FillWithRetries` only retries a transient failure. `Interrupted` says a signal arrived rather than that anything is wrong; a system with no source and a provider that refused are both reported at once, since repeating them would only take longer to reach the same answer. Its `attempts` is how many _extra_ tries to make, so zero is one attempt.
