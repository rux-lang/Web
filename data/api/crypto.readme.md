# Crypto

Cryptographic hashes, message authentication codes and key derivation.

## Installation

Input buffers use `char8[..]`; output buffers use `var char8[..]`. String literals can be passed directly as inputs. Use `storage[..]` for an array-backed writable output and `pointer[..length]` for raw storage. The caller retains ownership of every buffer, and each operation's documented output length still applies. Slice lengths count code units, which are bytes for `char8`.

```sh
rux add Rux/Crypto
```

## What it provides

- **SHA-2** — SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, and the two SHA-512 truncations.
- **SHA-3 and SHAKE** — the Keccak permutation, the four fixed-size hashes, and the two extendable-output functions.
- **BLAKE3** — unkeyed, keyed, and derive-key modes, with extendable output.
- **HMAC and HKDF** — generic over any digest, and the two-stage key derivation built on them.
- **Legacy hashes** — `LegacyMd5` and `LegacySha1`, for reading what already exists. Both are broken; neither implements the digest interface, so nothing takes one by accident.
- **Digests** — an incremental contract every algorithm implements, with one-shot forms beside it.
- **Constant-time comparison** — `Equal`, which takes the same time whichever bytes differ, because the ordinary comparison leaks where the first difference is and that is enough to forge a tag one byte at a time.
- **Zeroization** — `Wipe`, written so it cannot be optimized away.

## Value and borrowing model

Digest, XOF, and HMAC states are structural `Copy` values: copying a state takes an independent snapshot and owns no external resource. Safe mutation uses `&var` receivers, and read-only queries use `&`; calls borrow automatically. Construct default states with type calls such as `Sha256()`, `Sha512()`, and `Blake3()`. Descriptive variants such as `Sha256::New224()`, `Shake::New128()`, and `Blake3::NewKeyed()` retain their names. Raw pointers remain only inside compression helpers and the optimizer barrier, where contiguous word access or an opaque address is intentional.
